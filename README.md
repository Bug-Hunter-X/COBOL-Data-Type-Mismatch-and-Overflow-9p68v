This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in COBOL programs: Data type mismatch and potential for numeric overflow. The original program attempts to add 1 to a numeric field that may not have enough capacity, leading to unpredictable results.  The solution file demonstrates how to address this by using larger data types or adding appropriate error handling.
